and i eventually decided that i&#39;m gonna use this."/>

i stumbled on this article, <a href="https://olano.dev/blog/code-is-run-more-than-read">code is run more than read</a>
from hackernews and from there, i went into the rabbit hole of reading other stuff 
from the author and found the whole blog to be nice and also that it’s available to use, 
and i eventually decided that i’m gonna use this.</p>
<p>
I have many ideas for the blog but i want something simple to begin with</p>
<p>
i was earlier using hugo, and <a href="https://hugo-holy.pages.dev/">this template</a>, i liked it, but 
it felt too complicated for a blog,</p>
<p>
i like the whole tinkering with the blog to actually deploy something as well.</p>
