I took the 16 personalities test, I think around 4 years ago, when someone told me
how you can actually understand yourselves via it, how there are books, reddit communities and resources around it.</p>
<p>
I took the test, but my 16yo brain couldn’t really understand the value in it.</p>
<p>
Cut to few years later, I’m now 21 and realise how little I understand myself and how everything I do stems from there.</p>
<p>
If you understand yourselves better, you have the ability to understand others better</p>
<p>
and perform better overall,</p>
<p>
that is when i think i took the test again, it turns out I’m an</p>
<p>
INTP</p>
<p>
It has been a journey to understand who i’m</p>
