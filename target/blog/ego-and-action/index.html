Our Ego fights action with smart questions and doubts, and if you engage in those, you fell into the trap, it’s an endless cycle from others — more questions, doubts — right and wrong, and no progress. </p>
<p>
If you fell into ego’s trap, you’re dreaming, and dreams are way to live in results, external outcome focused (validation and reaction of others). It is a no creativity zone, as the dreams are built on conditioning of thoughts, which can only be from the past — it takes you away from the present &amp; the friction with an idea you’re dealing with, a negative barrier to action, as it pretends to you feel how it’d be once you’re there</p>
<p>
Attend to the present, giving attention to it, and that’ll lead to the right understanding and action; effortlessly. When the clouds are clear, you can see the sun; otherwise, you’ll only see all the shapes of the cloud and assume that’s real.</p>
