I don’t know but for some reason I feel we all don’t work hard enough — especially in larger companies. It’s a lot of BS aligning people, sharing status update and thinking how to get this x thing done by someone. 

With all of our products, we’re solving problems that changes the world in some way, but still in all the work we do, we put in so less of effort. I believe every interaction and line of code should be write as an work of art, something that we’ve done great research on and then found a world-class solution to solve the problem.

Most times, it’s living with constraints and limiting our creativity to imagine what’s really possible — this results in products that are subpar. 

Everyone is building products not so that it gets amazing adoption and users swear by it. It’s made to convince leadership for the next promotion or to show how we’re doing well — optics.

Until this is the case, we cannot move a needle and take a step towards making a product that’s really thought through. Another thing is we’ve already built a product and changing things is hard.

Today, good won’t do the Job - differentiation is table-stakes and experience is at all time high value.

In that case, taste matters, what you consume matters.

Think about how difficult it is for a physicist or researcher to come to a solution — It takes years and decades, I’m not sure how do we come up with Products daily. Is it even possible to build product that have impact in months and few years. It’s just really difficult — look at the iterations successful products or research hypothesis go through, here - we take one iterations and are running towards the next deadline and release. If we always do that, I don’t think we’ll be ever be able to build products that are differentiated.

Process it at the core of today’s product development — It’s not users or product.

If we really want to build the next Figma, Notion or Spotify like Products — We need to bring people with taste and low ego who’re willing to learn. It need not be 50 people, I think max 10 people should do. 10 people who are closely connected - compliment each other - with high creative energy and business sense. We’d need 2 PMs, 2 designers and 6 engineers.

We aren’t reinventing any wheel. It’s all done. Most things are done by other products. We’re essentially only copying and putting it all together in a good package.
