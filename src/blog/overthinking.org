Overthinking is a learned behaviour from childhood that once made us feel safe, we learnt only if we computed all combinations, and considered all possibilities, we'll then find a solution to be safe -- the problem is, most of us still carry this wounded part with us today, which drains our energy because things look bigger than they are, and everything feels overwhelming, so we either quit before we start or lose motivation. 

When we look at ourselves in these situations, we think there is something WRONG with us, but the reality is we need to accept this as a part of ours in order to recover from it.
