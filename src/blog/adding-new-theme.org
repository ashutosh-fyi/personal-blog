i stumbled on this article, [[https://olano.dev/blog/code-is-run-more-than-read][code is run more than read]]
from hackernews and from there, i went into the rabbit hole of reading other stuff 
from the author and found the whole blog to be nice and also that it's available to use, 
and i eventually decided that i'm gonna use this.

I have many ideas for the blog but i want something simple to begin with

i was earlier using hugo, and [[https://hugo-holy.pages.dev/][this template]], i liked it, but 
it felt too complicated for a blog,

i like the whole tinkering with the blog to actually deploy something as well.
